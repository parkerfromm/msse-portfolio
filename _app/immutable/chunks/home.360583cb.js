Proficient in C++ and Python, I have developed a strong foundation in backend and API development, particularly in applications requiring high computational power and data integrity. My specialization in artificial intelligence and machine learning was applied extensively during my master's, where I designed and implemented advanced molecular modeling simulations and software.

My experience is complemented by a capstone project with Raj Lab's Brain Networks Lab through the University of California, San Francisco, where I worked on optimizing a neural network model capable of predicting tau protein progression in mice with the addition of genetic information. As I transition into my role as an Associate Software Engineer at Northrop Grumman Space, I am eager to apply my technical skills and passion for AI to advance software solutions in aerospace and defense sectors.`,l=[{platform:e.GitHub,link:"https://github.com/parkerfromm"},{platform:e.Linkedin,link:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/parker-fromm-f11/"},{platform:e.Email,link:"parkerfromm@gmail.com"}],m=a("js","css","html","reactjs","sass","svelte","ts");export{l as a,s as d,r as l,o as n,m as s,t};
